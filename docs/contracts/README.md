# Engine docs (legacy / redirect)

This folder previously housed engine specs and inventory. The canonical, consolidated engine inventory and spec documents now live under `docs/inventory/`.

If you're maintaining engine specs or adding new engine documentation, use the canonical files in `docs/inventory/`:

- `docs/inventory/DiagX_Engines_Inventory.md`
- `docs/inventory/Engines_Core_Spec.md`
